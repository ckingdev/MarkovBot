Commits are referred to by a SHA1 hash of their contents.\n- Commits and their pointers to parents form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) so you can point to a commit by its SHA1 hash (or a prefix of it) and traverse all the parents.\n- Commits are immutable. You can discard or replace them, but only by discarding or replacing all the commits that point to them (transitively.)\n- *Branches* are mutable pointers to commits. There's usually a branch called \"master\", and a few side branches. You can always change what commit a branch points to. (This is a slight lie, read on.)\n- HEAD is a special pointer to the current branch. You almost always have a current branch.\n- All of the above describes what is stored in the hidden .git directory. Everything outside of that is called the working directory.\n- When you do \"git checkout master\", you're telling git to make master the current branch and to update the files in the working directory to reflect the commit that master points to.\n- When you edit files in the working directory, git will usually forbid you from checking out a different branch until you either undo the changes or commit them to the branch (make a new commit based on the old one & update the branch to point to it.)\n\nSo that's basic local operations. Here's where remotes come in:\n\n- When you add a remote and do `git fetch`, git downloads all the commits from the remote repo and adds them to your DAG, along with remote branches. Your master branch and the remote's master branch (usually \"origin/master\") might point to different commits! That's OK.\n- When you say \"git push origin master:master\", that means \"send origin all the commits that are on my master branch and update origin's master branch to point to the one mine points to.\" This will be blocked if there are also new commits on the remote, in whch case you need to merge them. (Don't worry about merges until you are collaborating with other people!)\n- The neat thing here is that if you push every branch you have to the remote, you've also pushed all of your commits. This is basically what cloning a repo is.\n- You can also pull, meaning \"make this branch look like the remote's version of it\".\n- It's best if you use the same branch name for both the local and remote versions of a branch, and use --set-upstream (-u) to let git know which branches correspond. If your local repo is on master and you say `git push -u origin master`, you're saying \"My master branch corresponds to origin's master branch, and I want you to push to it.\" You only need to use that -u the first time. After this you can avoid specifying the remote branch name, which is safer and faster.", "Wait, you're moving to github enterprise?

I'm gonna transcribe it here because yolo.\n\n\"During my stint with La Caravana my ideology about consensus confronted the realities of actually making decisions by consensus. Ideally, consensus strives for a completely flat decision-making process that recognizes and equally represents each participating member. Consensus formats in practice are grounded in reality. While inclusion and transparency are important components, value is also placed on experience, commitment, investment and privacy as principal elements of successful group processes. Consensus process offers limitless possibilities for solutions for the common good, but these solutions require determined engagement and commitment. Without committed participants willing to sacrifice personal prerogatives for the common good, the horizontal structure of power does not truly exist. \n\nWhen I traveled to La Caravana I naively assumed that they had achieved an egalitarian, utopian practice of ideals. And in many ways it was. It was an honest, brave, and determined attempt to practice the values and ideals of consensus. The general meetings were opportunities for open discussion and feedback with rotating facilitation. It was empowering and gratifying to participate in forums where diverse opinions were expressed at length, with persuasive detail and eloquence. During my tenure with La Caravana, I truly felt invested and appreciated in the process of day-to-day group collaboration. La Caravana was a remarkable example of consensus potential. However, it also highlighted limitations and the reality that the consensus process evolves perpetually with each communicative interaction. \n\nLa Caravana's nonhierarchal decison-making process was limited by the transience of its membership. The group's participants had vast differences in investment and experience. Its membership fluctuated through the years as the organization traveled through South America. Founders and long-term investors were granted organizational status as \"tripulantes\", or stewards. These pillars of the project collaborated to make decisions regarding personnel, budget, and organizational activities. Founders who had traveled with the project for many years could not be expected to relinquish decision-making authority to me as a new arrival. Likewise, because of my limited investment, I could not be expected to provide the day-to-day leadership or contribute to the lower-term organizational planning. \n\nI also witnessed how the success of the consensus process in fulfilling the mission of an organization ultimately hinges on the commitment of the participants. At times I felt that the short-term, transient members of La Caravana, such as I was, put unreasonable pressure on the stewards to accommodate our individual preferences. I felt I exerted improper influence on the direction of the organization even though I was not as firmly committed to the future as others were. I felt that the transients often resisted the existing governing structures and rebelled against perceived organizational authority. We demanded immediate gratifying attention and accommodation for our shirt-term sacrifices or else we would abandon the organization. Short-term participants did not acknowledge and respect the investment, commitment, and sacrifices of the lower-term members. The lack of understanding and knowledge of process by transient members, such as I, undermined La Caravana's focus and drained energy from their mission-driven work. ", "and I thought carrot... isnt here. ", "I thought carrot would find it interesting", "(one more paragraph I might as well copy here in order to finish the chapter's thought. \n\n\"While the consensus format offered by La Caravana was not the egalitarian vision that I had imagined, it was conceived as an attempt to equitably distribute the decision-making capacity of the participants with fairness and structure. The group had essentially formed two tiers of decision making in which the tripulantes retained budgetary and personnel jurisdiction. By dreaming up new creative approaches and refining organizational processes, the group continually sought systematized decision making that was reasonable for the circumstances presented. My experiences with La Caravana have shaped the group processes here at at our farm. I am not fixated on achieving a utopian, nonhierarchal system but rather a system that evolves with reason, transparency, and fairness. Invested, experienced, and committed participants should be allocated higher positions of authority to match their responsibilities while still continuing to be inclusive of the broader community. My experience with La Caravana reminded me to remain vigilant to disconnection between tiers of authority, abuses of power, and potential clique behaviours of subgroups\"", "oops shit im sorry i meant to put that under my other comment", "but i had to type it out top-level or else it bugs, and I forgot to move it before hitting enter :(", "Ooh, interesting.", "/me lives in a 9-member household run by consensus decision-making.", "ahh cool!", "I'm interested in how consensus-based stuff works both online and in meatspace", "I think theres a lot of parallels and similar issues that come up ", "how formalised is your consensus process, @hillmonitor?", "you can't have any puddingspace if you don't eat your meatspace", "I think a tricky thing about the internet is that incentives and consequences are different from real life (or even nonexistent.)

On its wild ranges the bobcat feeds to a large extent upon\nrabbits and other injurious rodents, but it preys also upon such valuable\nforms of wild life as antelope, deer, and other game animals, especially\nthe fawns, and on wild turkeys, quail, and other ground-nesting birds.\nWith human occupation of its former haunts, it finds in the young of\ndomestic livestock very satisfactory substitutes for its ordinary fare\nin the wild. When its food is less easily obtained in nature than among\nthe flocks and herds of the range country, it may become exceedingly\ndestructive to domestic livestock, especially to sheep during the lambing\nseason, to pigs, goats, and calves, and to poultry. The depredations of\nbobcats in parts of Arkansas in recent years have made hog raising on\nan extensive scale impracticable in such localities. Losses caused by\nthis predatory animal among sheep are particularly severe when lambing\nis conducted on the open range and the lambing grounds are in close\nproximity to the broken, rough, rocky canyons that favor the presence of\nthe bobcat. Sheepmen often choose such rugged country for lambing grounds\nbecause of the protection it affords against storms.\n\n\nNature of Depredations\n\nOn gaining entry into a flock of sheep at lambing time, commonly under\ncover of darkness, the bobcat carries on its depredations in such\nmanner as to cause little commotion there. The lamb is usually killed\nby a characteristic bite on the back of the neck or head, and then it\nis pulled down to be eaten. If its lust for killing is not satisfied,\nthe bobcat may kill other lambs by the same method, continuing its work\nquietly until a large number have been destroyed. A single bobcat has\nbeen known to kill 38 lambs in this manner in one night.\n\nBobcats are easily caught in traps of the common double-spring steel\ntype, in sizes 2 and 3. Such traps have been used by many generations\nof trappers, and although deemed inhumane by some persons, no better or\nmore practical device has yet been invented to take their place. The\nbrief description here presented of trapping methods to be used in bobcat\ncontrol is based on field experiences of Federal and cooperative trappers\nwho have applied methods developed by the Bureau of Biological Survey.\n\n\nWhere to Trap\n\nIn selecting a site for trap sets, one should be guided to a large\nextent by the tracks of the animal (fig. 1) and by other traces of its\npresence, which are commonly found in the rugged recesses of the open\nrange. Such places as leached limestone ridges, limestone cap rock, or\neroded granitic canyons containing an abundance of small caverns and\nholes surrounded by rather extensive underbrush form the ideal habitat\nof the bobcat. This may be in low-lying country or in adjacent higher\nmountainous areas. Though it is advisable to use the greatest caution in\nsetting bobcat traps, the care with which the art is practiced need not\nbe so great as in the case of the wolf or the coyote.\n\nWhen the trail of a bobcat has been found, by track or sign, along, or\nleading from its rocky lair, traps may be placed in either double or\nsingle sets. If the trail is not frequently used by livestock also, or\nby such big-game animals as deer, the so-called \"blind\" trap set may be\nemployed. This set is called a blind because no lure or scent need be\nused around it when completed.\n\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--\"Blind\" or trail set being placed for bobcats.\nTrails used by both bobcats and cattle make ideal situations tor placing\nthe blind set for predators during periods when stock is removed from\nsuch parts of the range]\n\n\n\"Blind\" Trap Sets\n\nWhether single or double blind trap sets are employed, they should be\nplaced in holes dug directly in the trail of the bobcat close to such\nan obstruction as an exposed root, a rock, or a clump of weeds, for the\nbobcat seldom fails to step over rather than on such an obstruction in\nits path. (Fig. 2.) If the double set is to be used, the trap holes\nshould be only about 1 inch apart, separated just far enough to prevent\ninterference of the jaws when the trap is sprung. Each hole should be\ndug only slightly larger than the size of the trap and just deep enough\nto hold the set trap and allow this to be slightly lower than the level\nof the surrounding ground. When two traps are used, they may be joined\ntogether with a lap link at the ends of their chains, which in turn may\nbe attached to a stake pin driven slightly below the ground level; or a\ndrag may be used either made of wrought iron or consisting of a fairly\nheavy stone. The drag should be bedded under the traps, in which case\nmore excavating will be required. It is well to have a free-acting swivel\nat the top of the stake pin to prevent a captive animal from twisting and\nbreaking the trap chains attached to it.\n\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Details of setting trap for bobcat in trail;\ntrap bedded just beyond a natural obstruction in the path; the working\nparts of trap are lightly packed with cotton to insure springing when the\nground is frozen]\n\nAfter the trap has been firmly bedded it is advisable to cover it\nwith fine pulverized earth similar to that found in the mound of a\npocket gopher.

But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n\nPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\npart. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\noverflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\nbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel\nlike it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the\nexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it\ndid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,\nas in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,\nwhich she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to\ncorrect.\n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst\nout:\n\n\"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand things,\nbut Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is\nbetraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign\nrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one\nthing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform\nthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will\nnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of\nrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of\nthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just\none.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial\nspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness\nof soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and\nstill seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did\nNovosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot\nunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for\nhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\npromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\nperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and\nthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word\nthat Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian\nneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty\ndestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!\"\n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\n\"I think,\" said the prince with a smile, \"that if you had been sent\ninstead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of\nPrussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a\ncup of tea?\"\n\n\"In a moment. A propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I am expecting\ntwo very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is\nconnected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\nFrench families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And\nalso the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been\nreceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\" he\nadded with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,\nthough the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his\nvisit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be\nappointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor\ncreature.\"\n\nPrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\ntrying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the\nbaron.\n\nAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\nanyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was\npleased with.\n\n\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,\"\nwas all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\nbeaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\ncourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pavlovna wished\nboth to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man\nrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she\nsaid:\n\n\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out\neveryone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\nbeautiful.\"\n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\n\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to\nthe prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and\nsocial topics were ended and the time had come for intimate\nconversation--\"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are\ndistributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don't\nspeak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like him,\" she added in a tone\nadmitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. \"Two such charming\nchildren. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you\ndon't deserve to have them.\"\n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said the prince. \"Lavater would have said I lack the\nbump of paternity.\"\n\n\"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am\ndissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\" (and her face\nassumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at Her Majesty's\nand you were pitied....\"\n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did all a\nfather could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\nHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\nis the only difference between them.\" He said this smiling in a way more\nnatural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth\nvery clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.\n\n\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father\nthere would be nothing I could reproach you with,\" said Anna Pavlovna,\nlooking up pensively.\n\n\"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\nchildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\nis how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!\"\n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\ngesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.\n\n\"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\" she\nasked. \"They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I\ndon't feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is\nvery unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary\nBolkonskaya.\"\n\nPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\nperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of\nthe head that he was considering this information.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\ncurrent of his thoughts, \"that Anatole is costing me forty thousand\nrubles a year? And,\" he went on after a pause, \"what will it be in five\nyears, if he goes on like this?\" Presently he added: \"That's what we\nfathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?\"\n\n\"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the\nwell-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the\nlate Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is very clever\nbut eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a\nbrother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an\naide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and will be here tonight.\"\n\n\"Listen, dear Annette,\" said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pavlovna's\nhand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \"Arrange that affair for\nme and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a\nvillage elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good\nfamily and that's all I want.\"\n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\nmaid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as\nhe lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n\n\"Attendez,\" said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, \"I'll speak to Lise, young\nBolkonski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be\narranged. It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll start my\napprenticeship as old maid.\"", "/me accepts apology", "sweet!", "sooo.....", "not quite yet :)", "yey!", "Ah, you filtered it.", "/me cheers", "apologize if this doesn't work", "\nme\n2:23pm\n==\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b>\ndangit\n2:23pm\n==\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b>\nme\n2:23pm\n==\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b>\nthere we go\n2:23pm\nPunbro\ncan I turn on hex keys and do it myself?\n2:24pm\nPunbro\nor is that really complicated?\n2:24pm\n==>\nWhat os?\n2:24pm\nPunbro\noh, windows\n2:24pm\n==>\nwhich\n2:25pm\n==>\nWindows what? 7?

On its wild ranges the bobcat feeds to a large extent upon\nrabbits and other injurious rodents, but it preys also upon such valuable\nforms of wild life as antelope, deer, and other game animals, especially\nthe fawns, and on wild turkeys, quail, and other ground-nesting birds.\nWith human occupation of its former haunts, it finds in the young of\ndomestic livestock very satisfactory substitutes for its ordinary fare\nin the wild. When its food is less easily obtained in nature than among\nthe flocks and herds of the range country, it may become exceedingly\ndestructive to domestic livestock, especially to sheep during the lambing\nseason, to pigs, goats, and calves, and to poultry. The depredations of\nbobcats in parts of Arkansas in recent years have made hog raising on\nan extensive scale impracticable in such localities. Losses caused by\nthis predatory animal among sheep are particularly severe when lambing\nis conducted on the open range and the lambing grounds are in close\nproximity to the broken, rough, rocky canyons that favor the presence of\nthe bobcat. Sheepmen often choose such rugged country for lambing grounds\nbecause of the protection it affords against storms.\n\n\nNature of Depredations\n\nOn gaining entry into a flock of sheep at lambing time, commonly under\ncover of darkness, the bobcat carries on its depredations in such\nmanner as to cause little commotion there. The lamb is usually killed\nby a characteristic bite on the back of the neck or head, and then it\nis pulled down to be eaten. If its lust for killing is not satisfied,\nthe bobcat may kill other lambs by the same method, continuing its work\nquietly until a large number have been destroyed. A single bobcat has\nbeen known to kill 38 lambs in this manner in one night.\n\nBobcats are easily caught in traps of the common double-spring steel\ntype, in sizes 2 and 3. Such traps have been used by many generations\nof trappers, and although deemed inhumane by some persons, no better or\nmore practical device has yet been invented to take their place. The\nbrief description here presented of trapping methods to be used in bobcat\ncontrol is based on field experiences of Federal and cooperative trappers\nwho have applied methods developed by the Bureau of Biological Survey.\n\n\nWhere to Trap\n\nIn selecting a site for trap sets, one should be guided to a large\nextent by the tracks of the animal (fig. 1) and by other traces of its\npresence, which are commonly found in the rugged recesses of the open\nrange. Such places as leached limestone ridges, limestone cap rock, or\neroded granitic canyons containing an abundance of small caverns and\nholes surrounded by rather extensive underbrush form the ideal habitat\nof the bobcat. This may be in low-lying country or in adjacent higher\nmountainous areas. Though it is advisable to use the greatest caution in\nsetting bobcat traps, the care with which the art is practiced need not\nbe so great as in the case of the wolf or the coyote.\n\nWhen the trail of a bobcat has been found, by track or sign, along, or\nleading from its rocky lair, traps may be placed in either double or\nsingle sets. If the trail is not frequently used by livestock also, or\nby such big-game animals as deer, the so-called \"blind\" trap set may be\nemployed. This set is called a blind because no lure or scent need be\nused around it when completed.\n\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--\"Blind\" or trail set being placed for bobcats.\nTrails used by both bobcats and cattle make ideal situations tor placing\nthe blind set for predators during periods when stock is removed from\nsuch parts of the range]\n\n\n\"Blind\" Trap Sets\n\nWhether single or double blind trap sets are employed, they should be\nplaced in holes dug directly in the trail of the bobcat close to such\nan obstruction as an exposed root, a rock, or a clump of weeds, for the\nbobcat seldom fails to step over rather than on such an obstruction in\nits path.

The drag should be bedded under the traps, in which case\nmore excavating will be required. It is well to have a free-acting swivel\nat the top of the stake pin to prevent a captive animal from twisting and\nbreaking the trap chains attached to it.\n\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Details of setting trap for bobcat in trail;\ntrap bedded just beyond a natural obstruction in the path; the working\nparts of trap are lightly packed with cotton to insure springing when the\nground is frozen]\n\nAfter the trap has been firmly bedded it is advisable to cover it\nwith fine pulverized earth similar to that found in the mound of a\npocket gopher.

The road agent needs to coordinate with the selectboard about bringing in an extra porta-potty for the event, and someone needs to decide who will get there early to turn the heat on in the building. \n\nAll of these things can have their own threads, potentially with very low activity. But I can have a clean way, as the Barn Dance organizer, of seeing an overview of where there has been activity and briefly look at what has been said.

I explain again that there is no actual cat, that I have a pygmy African hedgehog named the Spiny Norman, and that the only cat in the house is an adult Manx, named Cleo, who wouldn't touch purely dry food unless you covered it in wet food and jingled something shiny nearby.
